// Pool is a [coordt.StateMachine] that manages all running broadcast
// operations. In the future it could limit the number of concurrent operations,
// but right now it is just keeping track of all running broadcasts. The
// referenced [query.Pool] is passed down to the respective broadcast state
// machines. This is not nice because it breaks the hierarchy but makes things
// way easier.
//
// Conceptually, a broadcast consists of finding the closest nodes to a certain
// key and then storing the record with them. There are a few different
// strategies that can be applied. For now, these are the [FollowUp] and the [Static]
// strategies. In the future, we also want to support [Reprovide Sweep].
// However, this requires a different type of query as we are not looking for
// the closest nodes but rather enumerating the keyspace. In any case, this
// broadcast [Pool] would keep track of all running broadcasts.
